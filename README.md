# WebScreenshot

To install chromium (otherwise playwright will crash with exception):

In folder with build - e.g. "C:\repo\WebScreenshot\WebScreenshot\bin\Debug\net6.0" there is a script "playwright.ps1"

Just run it in powershell e.g. "C:\repo\WebScreenshot\WebScreenshot\bin\Debug\net6.0\playwright.ps1 install" (src https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/intro)
